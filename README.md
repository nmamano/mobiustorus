# Mobius Torus Visualization

An interactive 3D visualization of a torus with a polygonal cross-section and variable twist.

The number of distinct faces (i.e., colors) is the GCD of the number of the faces of the cross-section and the number of face twists in a 360 degree torus rotation.

Built with 'vibe coding'. You can see the exact sequence of prompts used in vibe_coding.md.

You can also see some of the intermediate states for context.
