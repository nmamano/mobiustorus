Settings: Cursor editor with claude-3.5-sonnet

1. write a python script that draws a 3d torus. make it interactive if possible

2. can you make the torus more like a doughnut? make the cross section a circle

{context: claude pushed back saying it was already a circle}

3. the problem is in the visualization then. the axises don't all have the same scaling

4. can you hide the axes and planes so there's only the torus left

5.

```
now the challenging part.


Add a parameter k, which you can initialize to 4 by default.

Then, instead of a circle, the cross section should be a regular polygon with k sides. like a square for k = 4

```

6. it didn't work. it looks more like a lamp

7. that's almost correct, but thre's a weird gap where some of the sides don't touch

8. still happening {context: I attached a screenshot of the gap}

9. color each face of the torus with a different color

10. help {context: the code was not compiling. I attached an error from the terminal}

11. add a way to change the k parameter in the interaction

12. can you add an option to add twisting to the shape. in one full rotation of the 'torus' each face has twisted to matchup with the 'next' face

13. It should skip twists where the faces don't perfectly match. So, depending on the number of faces, it should calculate the degrees to twist to align the next face, and that should be the smallest incremental twist

14. can you support one more twist, so that each face can match with its original starting face

15. here's a crazy idea. instead of showing the torus once, show it twice, side by side, with the second one looking at it from the opposite side (like from deep in the z axis i guess)

16. Nice!! I want the position of the 2 toruses to be related though. when i move one, the other should move too, but seen from the opposite side

17.

```
close enough. now the 2 are moving together as i wanted, but i'm not getting the 2 perspectives that i want.

the left torus is perfect as is.
the right torus should be as if i was looking at the left torus from behind
```
